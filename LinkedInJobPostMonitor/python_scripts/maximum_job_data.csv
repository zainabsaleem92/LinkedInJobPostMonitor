You'll work closely with senior engineers, learning from their expertise while also contributing your own innovative thinking. And you'll see the direct impact of your work reflected in the experiences of Amazon's vast customer base.

The ideal candidate has a proven track record of delivering new products and features, with a deep understanding of computer science fundamentals, experience building large-scale distributed systems and machine learning infrastructure. You're a self-starter who thrives in fast-paced, collaborative environments, with strong verbal and written communication skills. Most importantly, you're passionate about solving complex problems on behalf of customers.

In This Role, You Will:
• Design, develop, test, deploy, deliver, and maintain large-scale, highly distributed systems that are core to Amazon’s Advertising stack.
• Have the opportunity to grow and broaden your technical skills as you work in an environment that thrives on creativity, experimentation, and product innovation.
• Functionally decompose complex problems into simple, straight-forward solutions.
• Brainstorm with product management and partner teams about new ideas, technical design and project plans; make data-driven decisions to inform product prioritization.
• Drive mission critical projects, work with senior and principal engineers and mentor junior level engineers.
• Think out of the box!

If this sounds like the kind of challenge you're eager to take on, we'd love to hear from you. Join our team and help shape the future of Amazon Advertising.

Compute Cloud (EC2) has changed the landscape for computing - from startups through the Fortune 500. This culture of innovation has permanently altered how individuals and business think about computing resources.

Now, we look to change the game AGAIN with a new and disruptive model of computing. We are hiring innovative engineers for AWS Outposts - a start-up like opportunity to build a new line of business, with new technologies, from the ground-up.

AWS Outposts are fully managed and configurable compute and storage racks built with AWS-designed hardware that you can use to operate a seamless hybrid cloud. AWS Outposts extend native AWS services to virtually any customer data center, co-location space, or on-premises facility.

We aim to hire engineers who will thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative and open environment, who aren't afraid to dive-deep to solve seemingly impossible challenges, who want to build rock solid 24x7 never-fail, highly-secure, software at world-class scale and who obsess over customers.

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and we host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance. Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren’t focused on how many hours you spend at work or online. Instead, we’re happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a more productive and well-balanced life—both in and outside of work.

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews.

• Solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and system performance optimization.
• Experience working in Agile environments (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) with continuous integration and iterative development.
• Enthusiastic about solving complex, real-world problems through technology.
• Self-driven with the ability to take ownership, collaborate, and deliver in fast-paced environments.
• Excellent verbal and written communication skills, with the ability to articulate complex ideas clearly and concisely to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
